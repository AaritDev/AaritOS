📘 AARITOS — User Guide & Command Manual (Windows Only)

Welcome to AaritOS, your custom-coded virtual OS shell simulation.
This project is meant to be fun, educational, and powerful — not a real OS, but it feels like one.
🧳 What’s in AaritOS_Build.zip?

When you extract the .zip, you’ll get this:

📁 aaritos/
   └── aaritos_fs/       ← Virtual file system
📁 _internal/            ← Internal data used by AaritOS.exe
📄 AaritOS.exe           ← Run this to launch AaritOS

    ✅ Only works on Windows. Do not try this on Linux or macOS — it’s not designed for them.

🚀 How to Start

    Extract the entire zip anywhere on your Windows system.

    Double-click AaritOS.exe. (You must keep _internal/ and aaritos/ folders next to it!)

    On first launch, you’ll:

        Pick a username

        (Optionally) set a password

        Customize your prompt color and symbol

        Choose an editor style (vim or nano)

        Write a welcome message

After setup, you’ll enter the AaritOS shell. Now you're inside the fake terminal.
💻 Using the Shell

Type help to get a list of all available commands. Here’s a breakdown of what they do:
📂 File & Directory Commands
Command	Description
ls	Lists all files/folders in the current virtual directory
cd <dir>	Changes directory (cd.. to go up one level)
pwd	Shows current virtual directory path
mkdir <dir>	Creates a new folder
rmdir <dir>	Deletes a folder if it’s empty
touch <file>	Creates an empty file
rm <file>	Deletes a file
cp src dst	Copies a file
mv src dst	Moves or renames a file
tree	Shows directory structure recursively

    📁 These commands only affect the aaritos_fs/ folder. They don’t touch your real files.

📝 File Reading & Writing
Command	Description
cat <file>	Prints file content
type <file>	Opens editor (vim or nano style) to write/edit a file
head <file>	Shows first 10 lines (use -n for custom count)
tail <file>	Shows last 10 lines (same as above)
wc <file>	Shows line, word, and character counts
grep <pattern> <file>	Searches for text inside a file
🛠️ System-Like Commands
Command	Description
clear	Clears the terminal screen
echo hello	Prints the text you type
date	Shows the current system date/time
uptime	(Fake) Shows dummy system uptime
whoami	Shows your current username
df	Shows fake disk usage stats
uname	Displays OS and architecture info
ps	Simulates running processes
neofetch	Displays AaritOS logo and system info

    ⚠️ Note: Commands like uptime, df, and ps are fake and for display only. They don't reflect your actual PC stats (yet).

🔒 Security & Settings
Command	Description
passwd	Change your login password
settings	Modify your prompt color, symbol, username, welcome message, and editor
exit	Shuts down AaritOS with a cool animation
login	Shown automatically at startup — 3 wrong attempts = lockout
⚡ Executable Control (Real on Windows)
Command	Description
execute <file>	Launches .exe file inside the current virtual directory
kill <file>	Tries to terminate a running .exe process by name

    ⚠️ This can run and kill real .exe files, so only use it on things you trust and keep in the same folder.

🌍 File Browsing Modes
Command	Description
host	Switches to browsing your real Windows filesystem (starts at C:/)
aaritos	Returns to the fake AaritOS filesystem

    🔐 Use with caution! You can only browse real files, not edit them (yet).

🐣 Easter Eggs

There are 2 hidden Easter egg commands you’ll only discover if you:

    Play around a lot

    Or... 👀 check the source code

They’re harmless but fun.
🚧 Work in Progress Notes

    Some system commands (uptime, df, ps, etc.) are placeholders — they’re not connected to actual Windows internals.

    Shell history (↑ arrow) and alias, man, or pkg support are not yet implemented.

    Only the .exe file and folders from the AARITOS zip are affected. It’s safe and won’t touch anything outside unless you use host mode.

✅ Final Notes

    Don’t delete or rename _internal/ or aaritos/aaritos_fs/ or it will break.

    Passwords are hashed (SHA-256) and stored in a config file inside the aaritos folder.

    This project is for learning, terminal roleplay, and fun. It is not a real OS or secure shell.

    aaritos/aaritos_fs/root/config.txt
    aaritos/aaritos_fs/root/shadow

💬 Having Issues?

    Make sure you're on Windows

    Make sure AaritOS.exe, _internal/, and aaritos/ stay together

    Don’t run the .py file unless you’re editing it
